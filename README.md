## Logistical
  - What hours will you be available to communicate?
    - Class time + overflow after class
  - What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    - Slack
  - How often will you take breaks?
    - Every hour ish
  - What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    - Ask for help
    - Stay after class if needed

## Cooperative
  - Make a list of each person’s strengths.
    - Garfield: direct communicator, efficient, up front about asking for help/things he needs
    - Shelby: direct communicator, project management, collaboration
  - How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    - We will be efficient in collaborating on things that we understand well together and will lean on each other for things that we need a bit of extra learning on. 
  - In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    - Focus and depth of understanding concepts.
  - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    - Taking turns driving/navigating and discussing the code and plan of attack before getting started each day.

## Conflict Resolution
  - What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    - Voice concerns, reevaluate plan of work.
  - What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    - Voice concerns, rediscuss distribution of tasks.
  - How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    - Speak up about strengths/areas of opportunity and see where we can learn from each other. Teaching and repeating back concepts are critical to learning.

# Garfield/Shelby Book App

**Author**: Garfield Grant & Shelby Harner
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
